Train Connections
=================

Difficulty: hard

Problem Statement
-----------------

Consider a type `Route` describing a train route from an origin location to a
destination location with an associated departure and arrival date and time.

``` {.swift}
struct Route: Equatable, Hashable, CustomStringConvertible {
    let origin: String
    let destination: String
    let departure: Date
    let arrival: Date

    var description: String {
        return "ðŸš‚ \(origin) â†’ \(destination)"
    }
}
```

Implement a method that, given an array of such train routes, computes all
possible connections. A connection is a non-empty array of `Route` objects where
adjacent elements are joined on their origin and destination with the condition
that the succeeding route's departure time must be greater than the preceding
route's arrival time.

``` {.swift}
func makeConnections(from routes: [Route]) -> [[Route]] {
    // ?
}
```

Note that if multiple routes combine to a connection, each subrange forms a
valid connection as well. The order of connections in the resulting array can be
arbitrary.
